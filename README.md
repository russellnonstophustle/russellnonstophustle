- 👋 Hi, I’m @russellnonstophustle
- 👀 I’m giddy about learning new tech and addicted to bringing ideas to life.
- I enjoy making things, breaking things, and fixing things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js and doing daily CodeWars challenges to up my abilities
- 💞️ My passion to code was sparked by private server GTAV RP games and the hopes to build cool stuff
- I just wanna keep learning everyday as much as possible until my head explodes or I make something so cool I get addicted to playing my own creation and fall into a dark hole of joystick manipulation
- 📫 How to reach me; my email is crussell8690@gmail.com, IG @russellnonstophustle, or why not just text me my number is +1-619-342-5952
