- 👋 Hi, I’m @russellnonstophustle
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code to change my occuption and also just to learn a new skill.
- I would love to make an app to help complete my work at my current job which is Guest Services at a Surf Resort in Nicaragua.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and doing daily CodeWars challenges to up my abilities
- 💞️ My passion to code was sparked by private server GTAV RP games and the hopes to build cool stuff
- I just wanan keep learning everyday as much as possible until my head explodes or I make something so cool I get addicted to playing my own creation and fall into a dark hole of joystick manipulation
- 📫 How to reach me; my email is crussell8690@gamil.com, IG @russellnonstophustle, or why not just text me my number is +1-619-342-5952
